# balldrop_lab
A project represents the result of a laboratory experiment and a software implementation of a stand with an Arduino Uno microcontroller.
The stand has a spinning disk, a hallsensor, a photosensor, 2 magnets, 12 black and white sectors and a servo motor.
The idea is to implement an algorithm of a ball drop. The ball has to fall through the opening area on the disc. 
It's barely possible to predict the button pushing of a servo motor. The use of data from 2 sensors helps to calculate the right fall moment.

# start
To try this out open sketch.ino in the Arduino IDE.
The system asks you to create a new folder for the arduino project.
Accept it and transfer .h and .cpp files into this folder.
Upload the program onto your arduino microcontroller.

# data analysis - time and velocity conditions
1. Open the serial monitor in your Arduino IDE.
2. Open .ipynb file to get data from arduino and to visualize them on the plots. (Be ready to plug out and plug in your usb to get data from your arduino.)

# description
It was an enthusiastic solution to the task. All in all I was excited to try my hand. That's the reason for the publication.
